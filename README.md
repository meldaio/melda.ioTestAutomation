## 📥 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bilaydacevik/melda.ioTestAutomation.git

2. Import into your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).

## 🛠️ Usage
   Run tests with the following command:
   ```
    mvn test
   
   ```
 ## Reports
 Allure is used to generate detailed test execution reports. To view reports locally:

 ```
bash
allure serve

```
## 🔧 Configuration
Dependencies
 The pom.xml file manages project dependencies and plugins. Key dependencies include:
Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.
TestNG and JUnit for testing framework support.
Allure TestNG for reporting.
AspectJ Weaver for AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) support.
Maven handles the automatic downloading and configuration of these dependencies.

## 📊 Allure Reports and Jenkins Integration
This project utilizes **Allure** for creating detailed test execution reports. Allure reports provide insights into test results, including passed, failed, and skipped test cases. Reports can be generated and viewed locally using:

```bash
# Generate Allure report
allure serve
```

For CI/CD, the project is compatible with **Jenkins**. Jenkins can automate test runs, generate Allure reports after each build, and provide a historical view of test stability, which is essential for maintaining high software quality standards.


## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

Ensure Maven dependencies are installed.
Check Jenkins and Allure setup for CI/CD integration.
